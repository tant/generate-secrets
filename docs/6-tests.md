# 6. Test Automation Strategy

## Overview
This document describes the test automation approach for the generate-secrets project, including the test plan, test types, sample test cases, tools, scope, and integration with CI/CD.

## Test Plan

### Objectives
- Ensure all core features work as expected across supported browsers and devices.
- Prevent regressions and ensure high code quality through automated and manual testing.
- Meet accessibility, performance, and security requirements.

### Test Scope
- Unit tests for all business logic and utility functions.
- E2E tests for all main user flows and UI interactions.
- Manual exploratory and regression testing for edge cases and usability.

### Test Schedule
- Automated tests run on every pull request and before deployment (CI/CD).
- Manual tests run before major releases or after significant UI changes.

### Roles & Responsibilities
- Developers: Write and maintain unit/E2E tests.
- Product Owner/QA: Review test coverage, maintain manual test checklist, exploratory testing.

### Test Entry/Exit Criteria
- Entry: All features implemented, code passes lint/build.
- Exit: All automated tests pass, manual checklist completed, no critical bugs.

## Test Types

- **Purpose:** Validate the correctness of individual functions and logic (e.g., secret generation algorithms).
- **Tools:** Vitest (recommended for Astro/React projects).
- **Scope:**
  - All core logic functions (e.g., random string generation, encoding, validation).
  - Edge cases and error handling.
- **Coverage:** Aim for >90% coverage on core logic.

#### Sample Unit Test Cases
| ID | Description | Input | Expected Output |
|----|-------------|-------|----------------|
| UT-01 | Generate random password | length=16 | 16-char alphanumeric string |
| UT-02 | Encode string to base64 | "test" | "dGVzdA==" |
| UT-03 | Validate JWT secret (hex) | 32-char hex | true |
| UT-04 | Handle empty input | "" | error/exception |
| UT-05 | Handle clipboard API error | Clipboard API unavailable | User sees error message |

- **Purpose:** Simulate real user interactions and verify the application works as expected across browsers.
- **Tools:** Playwright (headless mode, multi-browser: Chromium, Firefox, WebKit).
- **Scope:**
  - Main flows: generate secrets, copy to clipboard, tooltip display, accessibility (keyboard navigation).
  - Cross-browser and responsive checks.
  - No secrets are logged or stored during tests.
- **Integration:**
  - E2E tests run locally and in CI/CD pipeline (e.g., on every pull request and before deploy).

#### Sample E2E Test Cases
| ID | Description | Steps | Expected Result |
|----|-------------|-------|----------------|
| E2E-01 | Generate secrets | 1. Open app 2. Click "Generate" | All secrets displayed in list |
| E2E-02 | Copy secrets | 1. Generate secrets 2. Click "Copy" | Clipboard contains all label=value pairs |
| E2E-03 | Tooltip display | 1. Hover/click ? icon | Tooltip appears with correct info |
| E2E-04 | Accessibility - keyboard nav | 1. Tab through UI 2. Activate buttons/tooltips | All features accessible by keyboard |
| E2E-05 | Responsive layout | 1. Resize window/mobile | UI adapts, no overflow or layout break |
| E2E-06 | Cross-browser | 1. Run tests on Chrome, Firefox, Safari | All tests pass on all browsers |
| E2E-07 | Clipboard not supported | 1. Open app in unsupported browser 2. Click "Copy" | User sees error message, no crash |
| E2E-08 | Generation failure | 1. Simulate error in generation logic 2. Click "Generate" | User sees error message, no crash |

## Test Reporting
- Test results and coverage are reported in the CI/CD pipeline.
- Coverage summary is included in the README.

## Manual Testing
- Exploratory testing for usability, edge cases, and visual issues.
- Regression testing after major changes.
- Checklist maintained in project documentation (see Story 1.6).

#### Sample Manual Test Checklist
- [ ] All secrets generated match specification table
- [ ] Copy feature works on all supported browsers
- [ ] Tooltips are clear and accessible
- [ ] No sensitive data is logged
- [ ] SEO metadata is present and correct
- [ ] App loads and works offline (if PWA enabled)
- [ ] Error messages are clear and helpful for all failure scenarios

## Best Practices
- Keep tests isolated and repeatable.
- Use descriptive test names and comments.
- Update tests with every feature or bugfix.

- Review and update test cases regularly as requirements evolve.
