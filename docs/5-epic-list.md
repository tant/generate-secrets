# 6. Epic 1 Details: MVP - Fully Functional Secret Generation Tool

**Epic Goal:** The goal of this Epic is to take the product from zero to a complete, usable MVP version deployed on Vercel. We will start by setting up the foundation, then build the interface, add the logic, polish the interactive features, and finally, handle the deployment.

### Story 1.1: Initialize Astro Project with React

* **As a** developer,
* **I want** a new Astro project initialized with TypeScript and React integration, TailwindCSS installed, and a modern UI component library selected and set up,
* **so that** I have a complete local development environment with a robust styling and component system to start building features efficiently.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. A new Astro project is successfully created.
2. React integration is configured in the Astro project according to official documentation.
3. TypeScript is configured in the project.
4. TailwindCSS is installed and configured for the project.
5. A modern UI component library (e.g., shadcn/ui, Radix UI, or similar) is selected, installed, and documented in the README.
6. An icon library (e.g., Lucide, Heroicons, or similar) is selected, installed, and documented in the README.
7. Prettier and ESLint are configured for code style and quality.
8. The README includes setup, usage, and documentation for all libraries used.
9. The project is pushed to a Git repository (e.g., GitHub).
10. Project runs successfully on both macOS and Windows (if applicable).

### Story 1.2: Build Minimalist User Interface
* **As a** user,
* **I want** to see a clean interface with a "Generate" button, a "Copy" button, and a placeholder area for the list of secrets,
* **so that** the basic structure of the tool is clearly visible.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. The page has a main heading (e.g., "Secret Generation Tool").
2. A button with the label "Generate" is displayed.
3. A button with the label "Copy" is displayed.
4. An area below the buttons is ready to display the list of generated items and values.
5. The layout is responsive, and the main components are centered on the screen.
6. The color contrast ratio between text and background must be at least 4.5:1 (WCAG AA compliant).
7. Essential SEO metadata (title, description, Open Graph tags, etc.) is completed for the main page.
8. The UI is accessible (tab navigation, aria-labels for buttons, etc.).
9. UI is tested on Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.
10. Wireframe or mockup is provided (link to Figma or image).
11. User-friendly error messages are displayed for any UI or browser API failures (e.g., clipboard not supported).

### Story 1.3: Implement Secret Generation Logic
* **As a** user, when I click "Generate",
* **I want** all the required secret values to be generated on the client-side and displayed in the list,
* **so that** I can get the information I need.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Clicking the "Generate" button triggers the generation of values for all predefined labels.
2. Each generated value must adhere to the **Secret Specification Table** defined in Appendix A.
3. The generated values are displayed next to their corresponding labels on the interface.
4. The entire generation process occurs on the client-side, with no server requests.
5. Unit tests for the secret generation logic are implemented using Vitest.
6. End-to-end (E2E) tests for the main generation flow are implemented using Playwright.
7. No secret values are logged or stored in any way.
8. Edge cases and error conditions (e.g., invalid input, generation failure) are tested and handled appropriately with clear user feedback and error messages.

### Story 1.4: Finalize Copy and Tooltip Features
* **As a** user,
* **I want** to copy all secrets with one click and see an explanation for each secret type,
* **so that** I can easily use the data and understand what it is.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Clicking the "Copy" button will copy all `label=value` pairs to the clipboard, with each pair on a new line (`.env` format).
2. A brief confirmation message (e.g., "Copied!") appears after clicking "Copy".
3. Each label has a `?` icon next to it.
4. Clicking or hovering over the `?` icon displays a tooltip explaining the properties of that secret.
5. Tooltip is accessible via keyboard (tab/enter/esc navigation).
6. Copy feature is tested on multiple browsers.
7. End-to-end (E2E) tests for copy and tooltip features are implemented using Playwright.
8. Tooltip closes on Esc or clicking outside.

### Story 1.5: Deploy MVP to Vercel
* **As a** developer,
* **I want** to connect the completed project to Vercel and deploy it,
* **so that** the MVP is live and accessible to users.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. The Git repository is connected to a new Vercel project.
2. The application is successfully built and deployed to Vercel.
3. The MVP version is accessible via the Vercel URL and works as expected.
4. CI/CD is configured so that any future changes on the `main` branch are automatically deployed.
5. Production build is tested before deployment.
6. Team receives notification of deployment status (success/fail).
7. Rollback instructions are documented in case of deployment issues.

### Story 1.6: Analytics & Testing
* **As a** product owner,
* **I want** to track basic usage analytics and have a manual/automated test checklist,
* **so that** I can measure adoption and ensure quality.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Analytics (e.g., Google Analytics, Plausible, etc.) is integrated and documented.
2. Manual test checklist is created and completed.
3. Automated test coverage (unit tests with Vitest and Playwright E2E) is reported in the README.
