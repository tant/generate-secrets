# 1. Goals and Background Context

## Goals
* **User Goal:** To provide an instant, thought-free way to generate secure and diverse credentials.
* **Product Goal:** To create a single-page, extremely fast, minimalist, and reliable web tool focused solely on data generation.
* **Technical Goal:** To build a fully client-side application with no backend and no user data storage, ensuring absolute privacy. All UI components and icons are provided by daisyUI for a modern, consistent, and easily themeable interface.

## Background Context
This project stems from a practical need: the fatigue and security risks that come from users constantly creating new credentials. Instead of struggling to think of an unused username or a sufficiently complex password, users can use this tool to complete the task in an instant. The product aims to remove a small but common barrier in digital life, prioritizing convenience and baseline security.
